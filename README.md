## A repository for storing the code and data used to create an insect size and mass data set.

## Structure
* There are three directories included in this repository: ```code/```, ```data/```, and ```results/```.
* Users should set ```code/``` as their working directory, as output files are created relative to this. 
* Files within ```data/``` are labeled relative to their origin or to the nature of the data contained within, e.g. ```genome_data/``` containing information on species genomes. 
* The ```results/``` directory is created if not provided, and two output files are created from the .R script in ```code``` outputting insect mass estimates, as well as estimates relative to genome accession number. 
* The output files contain information on the data source, taxonomy, state of the specimen at data collection, whether it was estimated using a regression, and the data having been adjusted to a standard metric (mg or mm), and converted from mm to mg.
